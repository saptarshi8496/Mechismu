# **Chassis Design & Fabrication â€“ SolidWorks & ANSYS**

This project documents the complete process of design of a rule-compliant chassis for Formula Bharat 2025. The work focused on ensuring driver safety, manufacturability, and compliance with competition rules, while enabling integration with subsystems such as suspension, steering, and powertrain. An inside-to-outside approach was decided upon to design the chassis. This meant that we would start with the design of the powertrain system, such as the battery module, gearbox, motor placement etc. and then work on covering the area as efficiently as possible with the chassis.

## Project Outline
After discussion with team members, we decided upon the following to be our outline for design of the chassis.

1. Finalise the outer boundaries of the battery module, electronics, powertrain and gearbox to get a rough outline of the rear of the car. This was important because proper placement is more important in the rear as the battery and motor were the heaviest parts of the car.
2. Finalise the outer boundaries of the front of the chassis by taking into account pedal assembly dimensions, and the two important templates - cockpit cross-section template and cockpit-opening template.
3. Design the front and main roll hoops and start designing the chassis using Weldments in Solidworks. Consider driver seat back angle into the roll hoop design as it would directly affect the firewall design.
4. After the suspension points were finalized by the suspension department, connect the points to the roll hoops, bulkheads and impact structures to
5. Carry out impact analyses to judge safety. The simulation results would give an ideal result and would not take into account any strength lost due to improper welding or misalignments, so we decided to atleast get a rough FOS of 3 to 3.5 for all tests. Changes were made to the chassis to make critical points more supported.
6. Prepare the weldments to be manufactured by printing their profiles on the tubes and manually cutting them.
7. Designing mounts for all components to be mounted to the chassis, from suspension, brakes, A-arms to battery, motor and gearbox.

### Preparing the Outer Boundaries

This was the first step in our design, as having a set 'box' to refer while making changes inside would make the design process simpler.

Three models were prepared - two templates for cockpit opening and cross-section, and one for Percy (95th Percentile Male). The rules regarding the cockpit templates were simple - they had to fit from the opening of the cockpit to a point below the side impact structures (for opening template) and to a point 100mm behind the rear face of brake pedals (for cross-section template). The models were created with dimensionns 10mm larger on each side in order to provide sufficient leeway for small alignment errors in the future.

The Percy model was used extensively to finalise the driver position for our car. In this, proper seat angle and side clearances for the drivers hands were measured and incorporated into the chassis design. This affected the height of the roll hoops and the distance from the front roll hoop to the front bulkhead. The height of the two roll hoops indirectly affected the angle as the top of the driver's helmet must be atleast 50mm from the line joining the top of the roll hoops. Also, the distance affected visibility - making it longer resulted in a more leaned driver.

### Preparing the Suspension Points

The suspension pick-up points were joined to the roll hoops and bulkheads in a star pattern to ensure maximum strength while keeping the design as simple as possible.

### Trimming the Weldments
